# Machine Learning Keyword Mindmap 
A Mindmap summarising Machine Learning keyworkds, from Data Analysis to Deep Learning.

## Why keyword?
Because the details can be found in the original articles/lectures. What I focus on in this project is the big picture of machine learning. Some parts in the mindmaps are blank, but I'm planning to build a complete mindmap in the future. 

## Tool and Note

I have built the mindmaps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) on Window environments. The images will be generated and be available under folder `images`.

In all mindmaps, I use ***capital letter*** (e.g., Principal component analysis) when refering to a method/algorithm and ***normal letter*** (e.g., dimensionality reduction) when refering to a catergory. Besides, ***!!*** is used for my personal note. 

## 1. Data Processing
Data processing, as an infomraiton processing, is to collect and manipulate data to produce meaningful information. The techniques in this mindmap is almost applied to a data type of number, special techniques for other types (e.g., speech) will be covered in other part (e.g., Sequence model part).

## 2. Machine learning process
In addition to the implementation/evaluation of a single model, the machine learning process should include all steps of project development where multiple models might be developed in parallel. Also, the procss covers checking points when new data arrive.
