# Machine Learning Keyword Mindmap 
A Mindmap summarising Machine Learning keyworkds, from Data Analysis to Deep Learning.

## Why keyworkds?
Because the details can be found in the original articles/lectures. What I focus on in this project is the big picture of machine learning. Some parts in the mindmaps are blank, but I'm planning to build a complete mindmap in the future. 

## Tool

I have built the mindmaps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) on Window environments. The images will be generated and be available under folder `img`.

## 1. Data Processing

## 2. Machine learning process

## 3. Machine learning algorithm

## 4. Convolutional neural network

## 5. Sequence model
