# Machine Learning Keyword Mindmap 
A Mindmap summarising Machine Learning keyworkds, from Data Analysis to Deep Learning.

## Why keywords?
Because the details can be found in the original articles/lectures. What I focus on in this project is the big picture of machine learning. Some parts in the mindmaps are blank, but I'm planning to build a complete mindmap in the future. 

Currently, the projects contains:

 * Data Processing
 * Machine learning process
 * Machine learning algorithm
 * Convolutional neural network (comming soon)
 * Sequence model (comming soon)

## Tools and Notations

I have built the mindmaps with [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) on Window environments but the software is available in macOS and Linux. The images are generated and available under folder `images`.

Notiations are used in all mindmaps includes:

 * ***capital letter*** (e.g., _Principal component analysis_) when refering to a method/algorithm
 * ***normal letter*** (e.g., _dimensionality reduction_) when refering to a catergory
 * ***star*** (e.g., _algorithm selection (*)_) when its details are given in other parts
 * ***bang! bang!*** (.e.g, _!! ensemble models get better results but they are only for competitions (NOT productions)_) for my note

## 1. Data Processing
Data processing, as an infomraiton processing, is to collect and manipulate data to produce meaningful information. The techniques in this mindmap is almost applied to a data type of number, special techniques for other types (e.g., speech) will be covered in other part (e.g., Sequence model part).

## 2. Machine learning process
In addition to the implementation/evaluation of a single model, the machine learning process should include all steps of project development where multiple models might be developed in parallel. Also, the procss covers checking points when new data arrive.

## 3. Machine learning algorithm
Well-known algorithms are listed and catergorized into groups so that readers can remember easily. If an algorithm is used for multiple purposes, it will be listed for major purposes and may be omitted in minor one. As mentioned earlier, I am planning to complete the mindmap in the future.
